"These examples are compatible with both TMCM1230 and TMCM1231 stepper motor drivers.
Users can easily switch between the two by replacing "TMCM1231" with "TMCM1230" or vice versa, 
depending on their specific needs and preferences.
This makes it easy for users to experiment with different drivers and compare their performance 
without having to modify the whole code or scripts."
