"These examples are compatible with both TMCM1230 and TMCM1231 stepper motor drivers and
can be used without any modification to the code except for CANopen examples, where the right eds file
needs to be added to the script."
However, it is important for the user to ensure that they provide the required voltage and
current to the board based on its hardware specifications to prevent any damage to the module."
